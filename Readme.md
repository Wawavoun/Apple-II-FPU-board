This is information about a FPU board I made for my Apple IIe.

They use AMD AM9511 / Intel C8231.

If you dont use interrupt (I mean if you dont have a routine that manage the interrupt) leave the INT jumper open.

The board can be set for 4 MHz clock or 2 MHz clock (one jumper).
Usually AMD --> 2 MHz, INTEL --> 4 MHz but double check the exact reference of your FPU. 

Have fun !
